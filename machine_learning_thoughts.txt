Machine Learning thoughts

Training set

1. Need to standardize player 1, player2, player3, player4, etc  (in relative terms of whose is scored on???)
  
2. Need to only look at one play mode, one map at a time (or at least remove neo-tokyo, wasteland, starboard)

probably also only want to consider a given rank? maybe this doesn't matter

3. Look at position (static) 5 seconds before goal

i.e. for each of { ball, player1, player2, ... } input x,y,z,yaw,pitch,roll 

In other words, take a replay, and slice it into positions that score within 5 seconds and those that don't

label as SCORING, NONSCORING



Then new positions can be ranked
